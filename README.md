Test Driven Development
===
I love TDD because I can simultaneously learn how to write clean code, how to verify whether my code works or not, how to refactor code if it doesn't work or messy. They are the most important things a developer should know. Fortunately, they build up the TDD life cycle as image below. I think it's useful for you as well. LET'S START!
